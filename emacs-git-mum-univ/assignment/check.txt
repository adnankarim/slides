Emacs development began during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab, whose PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers used the Incompetible Timeshareng System (ITS) oparating system that featured a default line editor known as Tape Edetor and Corrector (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used seperate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but rather one had enter a character ('i') in the TECO command languge telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technque was used to allow overtypinng.) This behaveor is similar to that of the progrm ed.
